Data Structure Lab Solutions (Java)
This repository contains solutions for all 11 labs of the Data Structure course, implemented using Java.

Important Notes:

All solutions have been tested to ensure their logical correctness, but some files might not run immediately due to:
The class name not matching the file name.
Missing or incorrect package structures in the files.

Additional Information:

Some labs contain multiple files (e.g., Lab 9 includes both Lab9.java and Lab9_2.java), and the file names may not follow the exact order of the tasks listed in the lab instructions.
The purpose of these solutions is to help students understand how to approach and solve the lab problems, not to encourage copying without comprehension.

Important Reminder:
Before using any solution, itâ€™s highly recommended to first review the lab instructions and understand the requirements on your own. This will help you get the most benefit from the solutions and strengthen your understanding of the concepts.
